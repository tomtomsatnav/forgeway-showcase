### `@dataclass(frozen=True)` makes an immutable record

You list annotated fields and Python writes the constructor and `==` for you. Assigning to a field afterwards raises `FrozenInstanceError`, and the record can be used as a dict key.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point:
    x: int
    y: int = 0  # a default


Point(3)  # Point(x=3, y=0)
```

### `sorted(items, key=...)` sorts by whatever the key returns

A `lambda` is a small unnamed function, handy here. A tuple key sorts by its first item, then its second, and negating a number puts the largest first. Python's sort is stable: items with equal keys keep their order.

```python
scores = [("fig", 2), ("pear", 5), ("kiwi", 2)]
sorted(scores, key=lambda item: (-item[1], item[0]))
# [('pear', 5), ('fig', 2), ('kiwi', 2)]
```

### A generator expression feeds a function one value at a time

It is a comprehension in round brackets, with no list built on the way. When it is the only argument, the function's own brackets are enough.

```python
total_letters = sum(len(word) for word in ["fig", "pear"])  # 7
", ".join(word.upper() for word in ["fig", "pear"])  # 'FIG, PEAR'
```

### `[*items, extra]` builds a new list

The star spreads one list into another, so the original stays as it was. It is a tidy way to add to a list you do not own.

```python
base = ["fig", "pear"]
longer = [*base, "plum"]  # ['fig', 'pear', 'plum']
base  # still ['fig', 'pear']
```
